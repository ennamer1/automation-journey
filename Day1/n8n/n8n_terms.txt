Fixed - Value written with normal string?

Variable selector - maybe when I select a data item and I drag to the modul configuration, i guese this operation is variables selector

Webhook - Maybe it's an alignement opertaion between two tools that can be done through a link or something else I don't know

JSON  - It's an output data formated between arrays.

Configuration - Is the paramaters that each module has and it's editable 

Authentication - is the permession access consent that service or the app you want to use
